# Flight Delay
Building KPIs based on flight delays from 2013-2023

## Background
As part of a passion project, I've decided to look at large dataset found on kaggle and answer some of the business questions using SQL and build a Tableau dashboard highlighting KPIs. Dataset that I am using is flight delay data compiled over the years 2013-2023 in US airports.

Tableau Dashboard : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jihyun.yu8257/viz/FlightDelayKPI/FlightDelayKPI#1

## Softwares Used
Docker, Azure Data Studios, and Tableau

## Questions to answer
1. When are the worst months to travel?
2. Which airline has the most delays?
3. What are the root causes of delays?
4. How has the delay changed over time? - both via minutes and counts
5. Which airport is the worst to fly out of due to delays?

This project is still a work in progress
